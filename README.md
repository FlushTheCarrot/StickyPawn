Sticky Pawn is a basic text editors/notes app i started to make my portfolio look pretty.



# Built In Text Coloring.
## Very Creative Friends 

I have alot of visual based friends who like to tweak things at random times while taking notes,
so i made a color picker that will format your text to the desired color.

# Change Text Size

## Format text to a desired size :)

Like any other text editor you can format the text size to any size you desire.

# Notes In Notes

## Ever wanted to take notes inside notes just to remember extra details ?

No ?, weird, sticky pawn as a mini notepad inside that you can write anything useful,
if you need to go back to a line just write it there so you wont forget.

closing it will completly erase the notes(mini notepad).
